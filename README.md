# A Discord bot written in Python
This is a bot that I created in my spare time to practice Python. The bot has a Youtube player script, a hacking minigame from Fallout games and plays secrethitler in different modules.

The music player has queue system, skip song and skip to seconds functions. It also has a user submitted playlist from which it plays semi-randomly according to like and dislike ratio. Playlist and misc data is stored in a SQL database. 


It works with config.ini file:  
[Bot]  
Token=  
[Database]  
Host=  
UserID=  
Password=  
DatabaseName=
